# In Progress


# Known Bugs
[1] - Pressing enter when characters inventory is empty results in a null pointer exception and crashes client
[2] - Arrows being shot don't appear at right place on map
[3] - Arrows only shoot in correct position when awsd key is held down, also causing movement. Perhaps they can just shoot in the Character.direction direction
[4] - FPS still sometimes drops to 30fps, intermittently
[5] - AI don't collide with characters
